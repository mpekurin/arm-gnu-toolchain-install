# Arm GNU Toolchain Installer

This script fetches available versions of the toolchain from [the download page](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads) and allows you to select which one to install. Then it downloads and installs the selected one as a Debian package (via apt).
